               <h3>Gandalf: Aries ♈︎</h3>
               <img src="images/gandalf1.jpg" alt="Gandalf"></img>
               <p>Gandalf is an Aries. Aries represents the beginning of the astrological new year&mdash;it 
                  begins the new cycle. Gandalf is brave when met with the Balrog 
                  in Moria and faces his foe with dignity and power. Although he falls 
                  into shadow in Moria, he is reborn into Gandalf the White. Gandalf 
                  is not only a natural born leader, but he is also passionate and 
                  quite loyal to Bilbo and Frodo.

               <h3>Sam: Taurus ♉︎</h3>
               <img src="images/sam.jpg" alt="Sam"></img>
               <p>Sam is a Taurus. Tauruses are known for their strength, endurance, and 
                  loyalty. They are down-to-earth and practical, but also have a deep 
                  love for nature and beauty. They also have a profound keeness for food. 
                  Sam has a green thumb and he's always right behind Frodo with a little
                  bit of Lembas bread.

               <h3>Legolas: Gemini ♊︎</h3>
               <img src="images/legolas1.webp" alt="Legolas"></img>
               <p>Legolas is a Gemini. Geminis are known for being deeply curious and
                  adventurous. They spend time deep in study, and go out beyond themselves
                  to quench their thirst for new knolwedge. Legolas is an elf and elf folk
                  usually stay out of mortal affairs, however Legolas decides to join the
                  fellowship anyway.

               <h3>Merry: Cancer ♋︎</h3>
               <img src="images/merry1.jpg" alt="Merry"></img>
               <p>Merry is most likely a Cancer zodiac sign. Cancers are known 
                  for their emotional depth, intuition, and loyalty. They are 
                  often introspective and guarded with their feelings. Merry 
                  is a complex character who is fiercely loyal to the fellowship. 
                  He risked his life for the fellowship and was always there when 
                  they needed him. Cancers have a strong sense of duty and family, 
                  and Merry is no exception.</p>

               <h3>Sauron: Leo ♌︎</h3>
               <img src="images/Sauron1.webp" alt="Sauron"></img>
               <p>Leo is ruled by the sun, the most powerful luminary in our 
                  solar system. Leo has many positive qualities, some of which being 
                  power, confidence and energy. However, when unchecked, Leo can become
                  a consuming power and can spell bad new for themselves and those around
                  them. Sauron created a mighty power that was capable of helping and creating
                  positive change around him. Sauron chose to use this power for ill,
                  for to serve his own agenda above all else. This relationship to power
                  is why Sauron is a Leo.

               <a name="frodo"></a>
               <h3>Frodo: Virgo ♍︎</h3>
               <img src="images/frodo1.png" alt="Frodo"></img>
               <p class="funParagraph" id ="testP">
                  Virgos are ruled by Mercury; they are cunning, giving and can be down to earth.
                  They tend to be perfectionists and take on too much and to do so alone. Frodo
                  very selflessly volunteers himself as ring barer, to take this burden to Mordor.
                  On several occasions, Frodo attempts to leave the fellowship behind, to go his path
                  alone in order to spare his friends. Virgos tend to forget that nothing worth doing
                  can't be done with friends.

               <a name="galadriel"></a>
               <h3>Galadriel: Libra ♎︎</h3>
               <img src="images/Galadriel1.jpg" alt="Galadriel"></img>
               <p>Libra respresents the ideals of balance and harmony. They are judicious,
                  friendly and compassionate, as well as living lavishly. Galadirel is an
                  elven ruler, and when she is offered the one ring, she takes this offer 
                  seriously, but is able to pass the test: she refuses the power she knows 
                  can destroy her.

               <a name="gimli"></a>
               <h3>Gimli: Scorpio ♏︎</h3>
               <img src="images/gimli1.jpg" alt="Gimli"></img>
               <p>Scorpio is a deeply feeling and unshakably loyal sign. They are mysterious,
                  very set in their ways, and sensitive. Throughout his time in the fellowship,
                  Gimli comes to love and appreciate his companions for who they are, even 
                  when they're different from him. It takes Gimli time to warm up to Legolas, but 
                  once they've bonded, they are inseparable and would do anything for each other.
                  Gimli is very much a dwarf and very much a Scorpio.

               <a name="pippin"></a>
               <h3>Pippin: Sagittarius ♐︎</h3>
               <img src="images/Pippin.webp" alt="Pippin"></img>
               <p>Sagittarius is much like Gemini; they are creative and love adventure. Pippin's 
                  journey on the fellowship brings him so far outside of his everyday life, more
                  than he really bargained for. He moves away from being a smaller-minded person and 
                  learns some hard lessons after adventuring too close to Saurons flames. Pippin is bright,
                  passionate and exciting, a classic Sagittarius.

               <a name="smeagol"></a>
               <h3>Smeagol: Capricorn ♑︎</h3>
               <img src="images/Gollum1.jpg" alt="Smeagol"></img>
               <p>Capricorn is an earthy, amitious and regimented sign. Capricorns have been known
                  to do anything for power. Smeagol used to be so much like the Hobbits of the shire
                  before he was corrupted by the one ring. He still shows signs of being highly regimented
                  and driven by the beauty and power of the ring.

               <a name="boromir"></a>
               <h3>Boromir: Aquarius ♒︎</h3>
               <img src="images/boromir1.jpg" alt="Boromir"></img>
               <p> Much like Capricorn and Leo, Aquarius also has a fascination with power. They 
                  are known as the humanitarians of the zodiac and tend to seek collective power for 
                  good. Boromir has been fighting a war throughout his life and watched many
                  of his countrymen die at the hands of the evils rising in Mordor. It makes sense that 
                  he saught out the ring to save his people; his intentions were pure and they
                  drove him to madness. Even after failing Frodo, Boromir jumps in to save Pippin and 
                  Merry.

               <a name="aragorn"></a>
               <h3>Aragorn: Pisces ♓︎</h3>
               <img src="images/aragorn.jpeg" alt="Aragorn"></img>
               <p>Aragorn is the Du&#769;nedain is the blood of the old kings, 
                  however, he ushers in a new age of men after the war
                  of the ring. Since first meeting Frodo, Sam, Merry & Pippin 
                  in Bree, his intuition and inner wisdom helped guide
                  the fellowship through tough and dark times. Pisces are feelers,
                  but they also know when to let go of control and allow things to
                   move as they must.</p>
